## üí° Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing a seamless drag-and-drop experience that allowed moving tasks between different categories, especially into empty lists. This was solved using `@dnd-kit` and a custom `DragOverlay` component to prevent visual glitches caused by CSS overflow properties. Another challenge was creating a fully consistent dark theme for the Ant Design component library, which was achieved by deeply customizing the theme using `ConfigProvider`.
