## üåü Features

### Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration with strict password validation (Regex) and login functionality using `localStorage` to simulate a user database.
- **Task Management (CRUD)**: Full capabilities to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Category Management**: Users can create, rename, and delete task categories (lists).
- **Task Count Display**: Each category header shows the total number of tasks within it.

### Bonus Features

- **Modern Dark Theme**: A polished and intuitive dark theme, fully customized for all Ant Design components.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Smoothly rearrange tasks within and across categories using `@dnd-kit`. Includes a `DragOverlay` to solve visual clipping issues.
- **Due Dates & Reminders**: Set due dates for tasks, with visual highlights for tasks due **today** (amber) and **overdue** (red).
- **Image Uploads**: Add a cover image to each task. This feature simulates uploads by converting files to Base64 and storing them in `localStorage`.
- **Real-time Search**: A search bar in the navbar to instantly filter tasks by title or details.
